Education
======
* B.A. in Applied Computer Science & Applied Math, William Penn University, 2018
* M.S. in Computer Science, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, 2021
* Ph.D in Computer Science, George Mason University, 2023 (expected)

Work Experience
======
### University of Nebraska Lincoln: Research Assistant
  * __Automated Complexity Analysis__: Designed and implemented an algorithm to analyze worst-case running time complexity of recursive programs. This algorithm can be used for profiling systems
  * __Predictive Failure Avoidance__: Abstracting inputs that leads to program failures (ex: assertion violations) and automatically repairing those inputs so that the program runs successfully with acceptable output
  * __Dynamic Invariant Generation__: Compute non-trivial numerical invariants from execution traces. Invariants are useful to verify the absence of errors in safety critical systems

### University of Nebraska Lincoln: Teaching Assistant
  * Compiler Construction
  * Software Testing & Verification
  * Intro to Computer Science

### Purdue University: Research Assistant
  * __NanoCluster Evolution Prediction__: Built a simulation tool to predict size evolution of solute nanoclusters in metallic alloys under irradiation
  
Relevant Skills & Coursework
======
  * __Preferred Languages__: Python, C, Ocaml
  * __Skills__: Git, Bash, Docker, Linux
  * __Coursework__: Algorithms Design & Implementation, Data Structures & Algorithms, Mobile Software Analysis, Compiler Construction

Honors & Awards
======
  * Graduate Research Assistantship at University of Nebraska-Lincoln
  * Graduate Teaching Assistantship at University of Nebraska-Lincoln
  * Purdue Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship
  * Dean & President lists at William Penn University
  * Rwanda Presidential Scholar
