I am a PhD student in the Department of [Computer Science](https://cs.gmu.edu/) at George Mason University. My research in Software Engineering focuses on automated runtime complexity analysis of recursive programs. 
Prior to joining GMU, I received my Master's degree from the University of Nebraska Lincoln and my BA from William Penn University.
