Hi! I am Didier, a PhD student in the Department of [Computer Science](https://cs.gmu.edu/) at George Mason University. My research interest is in invariant generation, currently focused on developing automated runtime complexity analysis of recursive programs. 
Prior to joining GMU, I was a member of [ESQUARED](https://e2.unl.edu/) lab under the supervision of [Dr. Thanhvu Nguyen](https://nguyenthanhvuh.github.io/). I received my Master's degree from the University of Nebraska Lincoln and my BA from William Penn University.
