This is a simulation tool for irradiation induced evolution of embedded metallic nanoclusters.  The tool uses the Nelson-Hudson-Mazey framework to predict the irradiation evolution of nanoclusters in metallic alloys, such as oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) steels.
In this work, we develop NHM simulation tool on nanoHUB platform, with a simplified user interface that enables rapid prediction of the effect of irradiation on the size of nanoclusters in a variety of Fe-based steels.
